I use this repository for educational purposes. I am practicing to improve my knowledge of Python and programming in general.

I am going through all the exercises from the Github repository from "100+ Python challenging programming exercises".
I am doing each exercise on my own before comparing it against the solution. I also make any changes based on the solution.
